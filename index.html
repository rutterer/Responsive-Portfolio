        <p>Always on the lookout for something new and different, I am excited to be shifting gears and changing careers. My background is in economics, in which I hold a B.A. and M.A. Between degrees, I took a turn as an entrepreneur, marketing and selling Pacific Northwest microbrews in Beijing, China (I speak proficient Mandarin). In 2013, I accepted a fellowship at Washingtonâ€™s House of Representatives and worked as a fiscal analyst for two sessions before jumping to the executive branch. I led the taxes and fees program at the Office of Financial Mangement (OFM) for three sessions before tackling a fresh adventure. I enrolled in a coding "boot camp" at the University of Washington, and now I couldn't be happier to be back at OFM in a temporary role as a developer. Whatever comes next will involve lots of code and lots more learning: just the way I like it!</p>
