        <p>Always on the lookout for something new and different, I am excited to be shifting gears and changing careers. My background is in economics; I earned my B.A. in the field at Reed College in Portland, OR, then my M.A. at the University of California, Davis.  In between degrees, I took a turn as an entrepreneur, marketing and selling Pacific Northwest microbrews in Bejing, China (I speak proficient Mandarin). In 2013, I took a fellowship at Washington’s House of Representatives and worked as a fiscal analyst for two sessions before moving onto a job with the Office of Financial Management (OFM). I led the taxes and fees program in OFM’s Budget Operations unit for three sessions before feeling the pull toward fresh adventure. Now, I’m honing new skills in web development and couldn’t be happier to have taken the plunge into UW’s Coding Boot Camp!</p>
